# SHOP API(E-COMMERCE APP)

## The Shop API is an e-commerce application built with express.js, node.js, and MongoDB, for online product sales. The app provides authenticated and unauthenticated users with a catalog of available products to purchase. Before placing an order, users need to add all the products they want to purchase to a shopping cart. After that, the user can proceed with placing an order which if successfully processed, returns a session id to the client. It is worthy to note that each user can have only one cart that becomes empty after placing an order. To create a product, you must have dealer privilege access because only dealers have permission to perform this action.
